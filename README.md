# minirace

Just two experiments with 2d topview race game systems.

In MiniRace.as you turn the car in corners of 45 degrees. By pressing left- and down-arrows simultaneous.

MikiRace.as runs on smooth angles. You basicly speed up with up-arrow and turn smoothly left and right with left- and right-arrows.

Both works with touch on mobile and with arrowkeys on desktop.

If you want to build it from the source. Then be sure to also include Mitella (https://github.com/Quinten/mitella) in your sourcepath.
